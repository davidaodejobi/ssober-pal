## Architecture/Folder structure

This project uses the basic MVC + S(Model, View, Controller, Services) pattern

- Model - The model helps hold the state of the application, and gives an API the privilege to filter, manipulate, and access the data.
- View - This is the user interface(UI) as it helps to populate the model's data(widgets and pages within the Flutter application). In essense, it is a visualization of information that the application contains.
- Controller - This is where most of the work and logic is done. The model and the view are interconnected, so the execution is reflected in the view part.
- Services - The services will be responsible for fetching data from anywhere we need one, and return the retrieved data to our app.
